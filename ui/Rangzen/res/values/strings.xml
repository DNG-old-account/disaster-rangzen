    <string name="aboutBody">This application is a prototype for a research project done by De Novo Group.</string>
    <string name="FirstTitleAbout">About the Experiment</string>
    <string name="FirstAboutParagraph">The purpose of this experiment is to evaluate a prototype of Rangzen, a new app for enabling anonymous communication during a blackout. Rangzen distributes microblogs (short messages, like Tweets) messages directly between nearby smartphones without the help of the Internet or other networks. Messages spread through the population one hop at a time, phone to phone. Since Rangzen is an anonymous system, it can’t defend against bad messages like spam by looking at who wrote the message. Instead, Rangzen fights propaganda and spam by deciding whether to trust messages based on your friendships with others. Messages received from people with whom you share mutual friends are more trusted.\n\nWe envision that this system could be valuable during episodes of censorship or natural disaster.  The goal of this study is two-fold: to confirm our previous simulations of the system using real-world measurements, and to collect a dataset of real-world measurements which can be used to inform future simulations.\n\nThis prototype app will use Bluetooth to communicate with the phones of other study participants when they’re nearby.</string>

    <string name="ThirdAboutParagraph">This prototype app will use Bluetooth to communicate with the phones of other study participants when they’re nearby.</string>
    <string name="SecondTitleAbout">What You Need to Do</string>
    <string name="FourthAboutParagraph">To participate, simply install the app and turn on Bluetooth when prompted. You’ll need to leave Bluetooth on for the app to function throughout the study.</string>
    <string name="ThirdTitleAbout">The Data We Collect &amp; Confidentiality</string>
    <string name="FifthParagraphAbout">We’ll collect data about the number of contacts you have in common with other participants, about the places you go, and about when the Rangzen app on your phone was able to contact the Rangzen app on other phones during the study. We’ll store this information in order to use it to study how to enhance Rangzen’s capabilities. We won’t ever share this data with researchers outside of the Rangzen project. Here are some specifics about what we’ll collect:</string>
    <string name="SixthParagraphAbout">We will collect a list of GPS coordinates of the places you go while the app is installed. We’ll use this to determine where and when your phone contacted other phones, and to evaluate the limits of Rangzen in making peer-to-peer connections. You can see the location data we’ve collected on the Locations page of the app.</string>
    <string name="SeventhParagraphAbout">We’ll also collect an obfuscated list of your contacts’ phone numbers. First, the app will transform each phone number of your contacts into a deterministic ID using a hash function. Since this ID could reveal the phone numbers of your contacts, at the end of the experiment we’ll remove any linkability between IDs and phone numbers by mapping each phone number to an unrelated identifier. This data lets us understand how messages would be prioritized based on people’s social connections.</string>
    <string name="FourthTitleAbout">Risks of the Study</string>
    <string name="EighthParagraphAbout">We are collecting your location and derivatives of your contacts. While we’ll never link this information to your name or other identifying information, and we’ll never share this data outside of our research group, you should know that no process of anonymization is ever 100% effective. Location data is quite particular to an individual, and a malicious person who gained access to the dataset might be able to determine whose data it was by studying correlations between the places you went and the friends you had in common with other users.</string>
	<string name="NinthParagraphAbout">The app may use more power from your battery or use a small amount of your cellular data in the process of collecting and reporting data to our servers.</string>
    <string name="FifthTitleAbout">How You’re Helping</string>
    <string name="TenthParagraphAbout">By participating, you’re helping to evaluate the effectiveness of Rangzen at moving messages between phones as they pass each other.</string>
	<string name="SixthTitleAbout">Your Rights</string>
	<string name="EleventhParagraphAbout">Your participation in this study is totally voluntary. If you have any concerns or questions about this experiment, please contact Adam Lerner (lerner@cs.washington.edu) or Barath Raghavan (barath&#8230;?). You may opt-out of the experiment at any time, and we will promptly cease collecting data from your phone. If you opt-out you can also ask us to delete any data we’ve collected from you, if you prefer. Deciding not to participate, or deciding to leave the study in the middle, won’t have any consequences or penalty. Your participation in this study is unrelated to your performance and evaluation in 61B.</string>
